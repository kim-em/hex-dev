/-!
Executable distinct-degree factorization surface for `hex-berlekamp`.

For a monic square-free input `f`, the executable loop computes the successive
gcds with `X^(p^d) - X mod f`.  Each non-unit gcd is recorded as the degree-`d`
bucket, and removed from the residual polynomial before the next degree is
tested.

/--
Fuel-bounded distinct-degree loop that maintains `currentFrob = X^(p^d) mod f`
iteratively across degrees. Each step computes the next Frobenius power as
`currentFrob^p mod f`, costing `O(log p)` polynomial multiplications rather
than the `O(d)` of `powModMonic X f hmonic (p^d)` from scratch.
