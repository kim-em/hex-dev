/-- Working precision (bits) of the interval reducedness checker. The
inequalities being certified carry slack by design: the dispatch requests a
`(requestedDelta δ, requestedEta)`-reduced basis but certifies it against the
weaker `(δ, 11/20)`, so size reduction clears `11/20` by `11/20 − requestedEta`
and Lovász clears `δ` by `(requestedDelta δ − δ)·d[i+1]²`. A fixed precision
decides them on a correctly-reduced candidate; any indecision falls back to
the exact checker rather than failing. The 128-bit width is fixed (independent
of input size) and chosen to comfortably exceed the per-step slack margins for
the documented input families, keeping every enclosure at a small, predictable
arithmetic cost. -/

/-- Fixed-precision interval reducedness checker. Computes enclosures of
the Gram-Schmidt data of `b` from its exact integer Gram matrix and accepts
only when every independence, size-reduction, and Lovász inequality is
decided with the enclosure strictly on the correct side. `false` means
"not reduced or indecisive at this precision": callers must fall back to
the exact checker `lllReducedInt`, which keeps completeness structural.
Soundness (`lllReducedInterval_sound`, HexLLLMathlib) entails
`b.independent ∧ isLLLReduced b δ η` at the exact rational parameters. -/

/-- Executable integer `Bool` reducedness checker over the `GramSchmidt.Int`
representation: leading Gram determinants `d` and integer scaled Gram-Schmidt
coefficients `ν`.

Verifies, over integer arithmetic only:

* **independence**: every `d[k+1]` is positive (`k < n`);
* **size-reduced at `η`**: `η.den · |ν[i][j]| ≤ η.num · d[j+1]` for all `j < i`
  — the integer form of `|μ| ≤ η`;
* **integer Lovász at `δ`**: `δ.den · (d[i+2] · d[i] + ν[i+1][i]²) ≥
  δ.num · d[i+1]²` for all `i + 1 < n`.

No validity hypothesis on `η` is required: a malformed `η` (e.g. negative) is
incompatible with a positive `d[j+1]` and the size-reduced bound, so the
checker simply returns `false`. Soundness
(`lllReducedInt_sound`, HexLLLMathlib) bridges to the rational predicate
`isLLLReduced` via the integer correspondence
(`Hex.GramSchmidt.Int.scaledCoeffs_eq`, `basis_normSq`, `gramDet_pos`). -/

The continuation value is returned *through* `unsafeBaseIO`, so the compiler
cannot eliminate the effect as an unused pure binding (the

comment on `runDispatchedFirstShortVectorChecksum`). -/

/-- Dispatch threshold of the size predictor `intervalWins`, as a multiple
of the working precision. Derived from the per-operation cost ratio of the
two checkers: the exact `d`/`ν` checker performs ~`n³/3` multiplications on
operands averaging ~`n·maxDiagBits/4` bits, while the interval pass
performs ~`n³/6` products on fixed `(intervalPrec + maxDiagBits)`-bit
mantissas, so enclosures win once `n·maxDiagBits` exceeds a fixed multiple
of `intervalPrec + maxDiagBits`. On the two committed bench families this
crosses over between n=25 and n=30 for harsh-cubic and between n=150 and
n=180 for random-bounded (paired bench on `carica`). The boundary rungs are
entangled: lowering the constant to pull harsh-cubic n=25 (where the
interval pass runs ~10% faster, about 0.5 ms) onto the interval side also
pulls random-bounded n=150 there, where the exact checker runs ~2% faster.
On that ~360 ms rung the ~7 ms cost outweighs the harsh-cubic saving, so the
constant stays at the value that keeps random-bounded n=150 on the exact
side and minimizes total absolute misroute cost across both families. -/

/-- `Nat.log2` (floor of the base-2 log) of the largest squared row norm. The
Gram diagonal dominates all Gram entries by Cauchy-Schwarz, so this single scalar
bounds the operand size of every checker and reducer pass. `O(n·m)` work —
negligible against either. A deterministic function of the input alone, so the
dispatches that read it keep per-input timing deterministic. -/

timing deterministic. -/

`intervalWins` picks the checker expected to be faster on this input: the

the checker tally, distinguishing all three outcomes. -/

`lllReducedCheck` (interval decision with exact `lllReducedInt` fallback).
Soundness (`certCheck_sound`, HexLLLMathlib) entails the property triple
`(same lattice, B' independent, isLLLReduced B' δ η)` and is the single
