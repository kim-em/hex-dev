# hex-roots-mathlib (depends on hex-roots + hex-poly-z-mathlib + Mathlib)

Mathlib companion for [hex-roots](../../HexRoots/SPEC/hex-roots.md). Proves **soundness**
of the certified root isolation: every `DyadicRootIsolation` witness
implies a unique simple complex root in its certified region (the
stored square for the Newton-Kantorovich disjunct, the circumscribed
disc for the Pellet disjunct; the region is always contained in the
stored square's disc); every
`DyadicRootCluster` witness implies exactly `k` roots with
multiplicity; refinement preserves roots; `sameRoot` decides whether
two refined isolations isolate the same root; and `mahlerPrec` meets
its separation contract. **Completeness** (every Pellet witness
certifies by `separationDepth`, so `isolate` never returns `none` on
squarefree input) is a separately scoped development, described at
the end. The soundness theorems are stated conditionally on a `some`
result and do not depend on it.

**Scope warning.** This companion is the heaviest of the `-mathlib`
libraries. The two theorems everything rests on, **Pellet's
root-counting test** and the **Mahler separation bound**, do not
exist in Mathlib: no argument principle, Rouché, or residue theorem
is in mainline (checked against the 2026-06-18 revision), the only
open PRs in the area are two stalled new-contributor residue drafts
([#29588](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/29588),
[#39232](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/39232)),
and the winding-number infrastructure for general contours remains
future work (Patrick Massot, Zulip
[#maths > Multivariate complex analysis][zulip], 2025-12-28; Junyan
Xu's étale-space programme,
[#31925](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/31925),
aims there but has not landed).

None of that generality is needed here, and the restricted problem is
bounded. For **polynomials** on **circles**, the hard analytic
ingredients already exist in Mathlib: the circle integral of
`(z − w)⁻¹` inside the disc
(`circleIntegral.integral_sub_inv_of_mem_ball`), the vanishing of the
circle integral of a function holomorphic on a neighbourhood of the
closed disc (`DiffContOnCl.circleIntegral_eq_zero`), the derivative
of a product (`Polynomial.derivative_prod`), and continuity of
parametrised interval integrals
(`intervalIntegral.continuous_parametric_intervalIntegral_of_continuous`).
What remains for us is the polynomial partial-fraction identity,
finite summation, and a homotopy argument, as itemised below.

One deliberate restriction: everything is stated for `Polynomial ℂ`,
never `MeromorphicOn`. Mathlib's `MeromorphicOn` permits the function
value at an isolated point to differ from its analytic germ, and a
Rouché statement phrased over it admits counterexamples through that
decoupling. This is what made LeanEval's `rouche_zero_count_eq` false
as stated (Zulip, Model comparisons for Lean > LeanEval, 2026-05).
Polynomials have no such subtlety, and the polynomial statements
remain worth contributing to Mathlib on their own.

Both developments are organised as self-contained slices with no
`HexRoots` dependence, so each can be contributed to Mathlib as a
separate PR once it has been exercised here.

**Newton-Kantorovich route for atoms.** hex-roots atoms carry the
disjunction `atomWitness = nkWitness ∨ witness _ _ 1` (see
hex-roots.md §Newton-Kantorovich atom witnesses). The `nkWitness`
disjunct admits a soundness proof with no complex analysis at all:
Mehta and Macbeth have formalised the Newton-Kantorovich theorem
over Mathlib from `ContractingWith` (Banach fixed point) in a
self-contained ~250-line file (see References in hex-roots.md; not
in Mathlib mainline as of the revision above), and the
specialisation to polynomials on ℝ² with the sup norm makes the
witness's exact dyadic quantities literal bounds for the theorem's
hypotheses. Porting that file plus the specialisation layer is a
third candidate-contribution slice
(`HexRootsMathlib/Kantorovich.lean`,
`HexRootsMathlib/KantorovichPoly.lean`). If the dual-route
experiment in hex-roots settles on Newton-Kantorovich atoms, the
Rouché-on-circles development below is needed only for `k ≥ 2`
cluster soundness and the Pellet atom disjunct, and drops off the
critical path for `isolate` on squarefree inputs (whose soundness
then rests on `T_0` coverage, a triangle inequality, plus
Newton-Kantorovich and the Mahler separation bound).

## Discriminant / separation development

The smaller of the two new developments, and the one needed first:
`mahlerPrec`'s contract rests on the Mahler separation bound.

### Theorem chain

1. **Discriminant nonvanishing.** A positive-degree separable polynomial
   has nonzero discriminant, and an integer polynomial whose rational cast is
   separable satisfies `1 ≤ |discr f|`. The rational-cast condition is the
   roots-facing squarefreeness notion; squarefreeness in `ℤ[x]` would also
   constrain the content. Lives in `HexPolyZMathlib/Discriminant.lean`.

2. **Discriminant root-product formula:**
   `discr f = lc(f)^{2n−2} · ∏_{i<j}(αᵢ − αⱼ)²` over the splitting
   field. Mathlib has the resultant version
   (`resultant_eq_prod_roots_sub`); we derive the discriminant version
   through `resultant_deriv`. Lives in
   `HexPolyZMathlib/Discriminant.lean`.

3. **Mahler separation bound:**
   ```
   ∀ i ≠ j, |αᵢ − αⱼ| ≥ √3 · n^{−(n+2)/2} · |disc p|^{1/2} · M(p)^{−(n−1)}
   ```
   for squarefree `p ∈ ℤ[x]` of degree `n ≥ 2`. The proof bounds the
   Vandermonde determinant of the roots two ways: its square is
   `disc p / lc(p)^{2n−2}` by item 2, and Hadamard's inequality bounds
   it above column-by-column, with one column rescaled to expose the
   factor `|αᵢ − αⱼ|`. Mahler's original argument is exactly this;
   Mignotte and Ştefănescu, ch. 4, give a self-contained version
   suitable for direct formalisation. (A naive bound on the individual
   factors `|αᵢ − αⱼ| ≤ 2·M(p)` does *not* reach the stated constant;
   Hadamard is essential.) The Hex-independent column estimates and
   discriminant/Vandermonde identity live in
   `HexPolyZMathlib/MahlerSeparation.lean`; companion-specific executable
   exponent arithmetic stays with the relevant roots library.

4. **`mahlerPrec` correctness:** the computational
   `Hex.mahlerPrec p : Nat` (defined in `HexRoots/MahlerPrec.lean`)
   satisfies the companion theorem
   ```
   mahlerPrec_separates
       (hsep : ((toPolynomial p).map (Int.castRingHom ℚ)).Separable)
       (hr₁ : (toPolyℂ p).IsRoot z₁)
       (hr₂ : (toPolyℂ p).IsRoot z₂)
       (hne : z₁ ≠ z₂) :
     2^{−mahlerPrec p} · 1449/1024 < ‖z₁ - z₂‖ / 4
   ```
   Thus it gives the advertised `sep(p) / 4` bound uniformly over distinct
   roots. The rational separability hypothesis is the squarefreeness notion
   used here; integral-polynomial `Squarefree` would incorrectly reject
   nonprimitive polynomials with simple rational roots. The left side bounds the
   circumscribed-disc radius at that precision from above. Combines
   item 3 with Landau's
   `mahlerMeasure_le_sqrt_natDegree_add_one_mul_supNorm` to remove
   `M(p)` in favour of the integer `‖p‖∞`. Lives in
   `HexRootsMathlib/MahlerPrec.lean`.

## Rouché-on-circles development

The harder of the two developments. It supplies the semantics of the
Pellet witnesses.

### Theorem chain

5. **Partial fractions for `p'/p`**: for `0 ≠ p : ℂ[X]` and `z` off
   the roots,
   ```
   p'(z) / p(z) = Σ_{α ∈ p.roots} (z − α)⁻¹
   ```
   summing over the root multiset (so an m-fold root contributes m
   terms). From the factorisation of `p` over ℂ and
   `Polynomial.derivative_prod`, plus circle-integrability of each
   summand. Lives in `HexRootsMathlib/CircleIntegralLemmas.lean`.

6. **Argument principle for polynomials on circles:**
   ```
   (1/2πi) · ∮_{|z−c|=r} (p'(z) / p(z)) dz = (Polynomial.roots p).countP (· ∈ ball c r)
   ```
   for `p ≠ 0` with no zeros on `|z−c| = r`; the count is with
   multiplicity, since `Polynomial.roots` is a multiset. By item 5
   and linearity of the circle integral over the finite sum: each
   root inside contributes `2πi`
   (`circleIntegral.integral_sub_inv_of_mem_ball`), each root outside
   contributes `0` (`DiffContOnCl.circleIntegral_eq_zero`, as
   `(z − α)⁻¹` is then holomorphic near the closed disc). No winding
   numbers and no meromorphic API. Lives in
   `HexRootsMathlib/ArgumentPrinciple.lean`.

7. **Rouché for polynomials on circles**, classical form (`|f − g| <
   |g|` on the circle implies `f` and `g` have the same number of
   zeros inside) and symmetric form (`|f − g| < |f| + |g|` likewise).
   Proof by homotopy: `h_t := g + t·(f − g)` has no zero on the
   circle for `t ∈ [0, 1]`, its root count is given by item 6, the
   count varies continuously in `t`
   (`continuous_parametric_intervalIntegral_of_continuous`), and an
   integer-valued continuous function on `[0, 1]` is constant. Lives
   in `HexRootsMathlib/Rouche.lean`.

8. **Pellet (BSSY Theorem 1):**
   ```
   |c_k|·r^k > Σ_{i ≠ k} |c_i|·r^i   ⇒   p has exactly k roots in D(0, r)
   ```
   where `cᵢ = p.coeff i` and the count is with multiplicity. Proved
   by applying Rouché to `p` and the monomial `c_k · z^k`. Lives in
   `HexRootsMathlib/Pellet.lean`.

The computational library never states this inequality directly: its
witness compares dyadic bounds (`lo`, `hi`, and the rational `√2`
bounds; see [hex-roots.md](../../HexRoots/SPEC/hex-roots.md)). The one-directional lemma
"the dyadic-bound witness implies the exact Pellet inequality" lives
in `HexRootsMathlib/Geometry.lean`, so the analytic development above
stays in the standard form (the form worth contributing to Mathlib)
while the computational library stays decidable. The converse
direction, that a sufficiently isolating disc makes the witness hold
despite the factor-2 slack, belongs to the completeness development
below.

## Correspondence theorems

These files connect the `HexRoots` data structures to the two
developments above.

- `HexRootsMathlib/Basic.lean`: exact `Dyadic → ℝ` and
  `GaussDyadic → ℂ` casts and their algebra/order correspondence.
- `HexRootsMathlib/Geometry.lean`: `lo(c) ≤ |c| ≤ hi(c)`, the
  `181/128 < √2 < 1449/1024` bounds, and the Mathlib geometry of a
  `DyadicSquare`: its complex centre, real half-width, closed sup-norm
  square, and open/closed circumscribed discs. Simp lemmas
  `DyadicSquare.center_eq`, `DyadicSquare.disc_eq`. The later Pellet
  correspondence in this module proves "witness implies Pellet".
- `HexRootsMathlib/Taylor.lean`: the shared exact-coefficient bridge
  ```lean
  theorem taylor_coeff (p : ZPoly) (z : GaussDyadic) (k : Nat) :
      toComplex ((taylor p z).getD k (0, 0)) =
        ((toPolyℂ p).comp (X + C (toComplex z))).coeff k
  ```
  including the out-of-bounds case. Its proof consumes the executable
  `taylor_getD` characterization rather than unfolding the in-place folds.
- `HexRootsMathlib/HasOnlySimpleRoots.lean`:
  for `p ≠ 0`, `Hex.HasOnlySimpleRoots p` is equivalent to separability of
  `(toPolynomial p).map (Int.castRingHom ℚ)`. Connects
  the executable test (the `ℚ[x]` gcd of `p` and `p'` is constant)
  with Mathlib's rational-polynomial separability API. This is deliberately
  not integral-polynomial `Squarefree`, which is sensitive to nonunit content.
- `HexRootsMathlib/MahlerPrec.lean`: item 4 above.
- `HexRootsMathlib/SimpleRoot.lean`: the semantics of root identity.
  ```lean
  /-- The unique root inside a refined isolation's certified region
      (the stored square for the Newton-Kantorovich disjunct, the
      circumscribed disc for the Pellet disjunct). The quotient
      argument below needs only that each root lies in its own
      isolation's disc, which both disjuncts give. -/
  def RefinedIsolation.root (i : RefinedIsolation p) : ℂ

  theorem intersects_iff_root_eq
      (hsep : (HexPolyZMathlib.toPolyℚ p).Separable)
      (i₁ i₂ : RefinedIsolation p) :
      Intersects i₁ i₂ ↔ i₁.root = i₂.root
  ```
  A local atom witness makes its selected root simple but does not imply
  global separability, so the separation premise is necessary. Successful
  nonzero `isolate` input obtains it from `HasOnlySimpleRoots`; the companion
  also exposes `intersects_iff_root_eq_of_simple` with those hypotheses.
  Under the same premise, `Intersects` restricted to `RefinedIsolation p` is
  an equivalence relation; `Hex.rootOf` is well-defined by `Quot.lift`; and
  `sameRoot i₁ i₂ = true ↔ SimpleRoot.mk i₁ = SimpleRoot.mk i₂`, so the
  Boolean test used by the Mathlib-free layer decides equality in the
  quotient. The `< sep/4` radius bound from item 4 makes the conditional
  `intersects_iff_root_eq` theorem true.
- `HexRootsMathlib/Cauchy.lean`: `Component.cauchy`
  correctness. The starting closed square contains all of `Polynomial.roots p`
  by `Polynomial.IsRoot.norm_lt_cauchyBound`: the executable maximum bounds
  every non-leading coefficient, its ceiling division bounds Mathlib's
  Cauchy bound, and `ceilLog2` rounds that integer bound up to the square's
  power-of-two half-width. The degree-`n`
  witness holds at the base, doubled, and quadrupled radii because the
  leading-term inequality `|aₙ|·Rⁿ > Σ_{i<n}|aᵢ|·Rⁱ` only improves as
  `R` grows past the Cauchy bound.
- `HexRootsMathlib/Newton.lean`: `newton1?` and `refineTo?`
  soundness. When they return `some iso'`, `iso'` isolates the same
  root and `iso'.square.prec > iso.square.prec`
  (`sameRoot`-preservation is the statement the threading pattern in
  hex-roots.md relies on). Uses `Polynomial.newtonMap`,
  `aeval_pow_two_pow_dvd_aeval_iterate_newtonMap`, and the
  `Dyadic.invAtPrec` error bounds.
- `HexRootsMathlib/RootFree.lean`: elementary `T₀` soundness. The exact
  accumulator inequality and the Taylor coefficient bridge imply, by the
  finite triangle inequality, that a successful `rootFree` test excludes
  roots from the open disc of radius `radiusHi`. This contains both the
  represented closed square and its true closed circumscribed disc because
  `√2 < 1449/1024`.
- `HexRootsMathlib/Bisection.lean`: elementary subdivision coverage. The four
  closed children cover the parent, and every child containing a root survives
  the `rootFree` filter. They are not pairwise disjoint, since adjacent
  children share boundary segments. `HexRootsMathlib/Glue.lean` proves that
  the executable union-by-insertion `glue` returns nonempty maximal
  edge-or-corner-connected components, that distinct components have no
  executable adjacency edge,
  and that flattening its output permutes its input. In particular the
  defensive singleton fallback in `glueCovered` is unreachable. Hence a
  `T_0`-discarded child's disc
  contains no root, so every root covered by the parent lies in some
  retained child; when `certify?` returns a cluster, its disc
  contains exactly `k` roots with multiplicity (Pellet, item 8); when
  it returns an atom, the certified region contains exactly one
  simple root (Newton-Kantorovich or Pellet at `k = 1`); and the
  coverage guard makes an accepted speculative-Newton region contain
  exactly the roots of the base region.
- `HexRootsMathlib/Driver.lean` and `HexRootsMathlib/Isolate.lean`: driver
  soundness. Retained squares cover every root, output discs are pairwise
  disjoint, and each certificate has its asserted multiplicity count. Thus
  the general driver's certificate counts sum to the polynomial degree; when
  `isolate` successfully extracts only atoms, their distinct semantic roots
  enumerate the root finset exactly.
  ```lean
  theorem isolateAll_count (p : ZPoly)
      (h : 0 < p.degree?.getD 0) {target strategy result}
      (hr : isolateAll? p target #[Component.cauchy p h] strategy = some result) :
      ∑ i : Fin result.size, Certified.count result[i] = (toPolyℂ p).natDegree

  theorem isolate_sound (p : ZPoly) (h : Hex.HasOnlySimpleRoots p)
      (atom_prec : Int) (strategy : AtomStrategy) {atoms}
      (ha : isolate p h atom_prec strategy = some atoms) :
      (atoms.toList.map (·.root)).toFinset = (toPolyℂ p).roots.toFinset ∧
      ∀ a ∈ atoms, atom_prec ≤ a.square.prec
  ```
  (`HasOnlySimpleRoots p` does *not* rule out `p = 0` (the
  executable gcd of `0` and `0` is `0`, of size `0 ≤ 1`), but
  `isolate 0 _ _ = none` by definition, so the `ha` hypothesis
  supplies nonzeroness; a nonzero constant returns `some #[]` and
  both sides are empty. The rational-separability correspondence in
  `HasOnlySimpleRoots.lean` carries a `p ≠ 0` hypothesis for the same reason.)
- `HexRootsMathlib/Refinement.lean`: a successful
  `DyadicRootIsolation.refineTo?` call preserves the raw atom's semantic root.
  The refined-level wrapper preserves `RefinedIsolation.root` unconditionally
  by exposing the successful underlying raw refinement call; the packaged
  quotient equality remains available to Mathlib-free callers.

## Completeness development (separately scoped)

Soundness above never claims the drivers succeed. Completeness does,
and it is the analytically hardest part:

9. **Pellet converse with margin**: if the disc is
   `(ρ₁, ρ₂)`-isolating with a wide enough ratio, then the
   dyadic-bound witness holds. Without Graeffe iteration the required
   ratio is *linear in `deg p`* (each remote root contributes to the
   higher Taylor coefficients; the relevant bound is
   `(1 + ρ/d)^{n−1} − 1`), times a fixed factor absorbing the
   factor-2 witness slack. This is what `separationDepth`'s
   `ceilLog2 (deg p)` term supplies.
   `Completeness/PelletTail.lean` supplies the Mathlib-only combinatorial
   core: if every remote root has norm at least `d`, the positive-degree
   elementary-symmetric tail of the normalized product is bounded by
   `(1 + ρ/d)^n - 1`. `Completeness/PelletConverse.lean` connects this
   estimate to the translated polynomial with root multiplicities and its
   leading coefficient intact. In particular, with near-root offset `a`,
   `m` remote roots, and `E = (1 + ρ/d)^m - 1`, the concrete margin
   `|a| + (ρ + 3|a|) E < ρ` implies the exact strict `k = 1` coefficient
   dominance consumed by Pellet's theorem. `Completeness/PelletDyadic.lean`
   then absorbs the factor-two `lo`/`hi` coefficient loss and the distinct
   executable radius bounds. At each of the base, doubled, and quadrupled
   radii, writing `R = radiusHi`, `r = radiusLo`, it uses the explicit margin
   `2|a| + (2R + 5|a|)((1 + R/d)^m - 1) < r`; the three margins imply the
   actual executable `witness p s 1` proposition.
10. **Newton success**: on a sufficiently refined atom the speculative
    Newton step recertifies (via `ContractingWith` on the Newton map).
    `Completeness/NewtonContraction.lean` supplies the analytic foundation:
    the frozen exact-inverse Newton map at every simple root has a positive
    sup-norm ball for every positive defect target `K`, on which its residual
    is at most `(1 + K)` times the centre displacement. At `K = 1/2` it also
    preserves the ball, contracts, and has the original root as its unique
    fixed point. The following executable-recertification slice chooses a
    smaller `K` and transfers the resulting strict margins to the dyadic
    inverse and Taylor bounds. `Completeness/NKRecertification.lean` performs
    that transfer: the pinned reciprocal has relative defect `< 2⁻⁸`; the
    floored inverse is a scalar in `[0,1]` times the exact centre inverse; and
    a continuous exact-centre majorant bounds the finite `z₂` sum while the
    square radius tends to zero. Consequently every simple root has a natural
    precision threshold beyond which every doubled square with centre distance
    at most half its half-width satisfies the actual executable `nkWitness`.
    `Completeness/NKConverse.lean` gives the complementary explicit
    root-product estimate: if all other roots are at distance `d` and
    `(1 + 4R/d)^m - 1 ≤ 1/32`, the exact executable witness succeeds.
    `Completeness/NKDepth.lean` proves that the implemented
    `separationDepth` makes this tail small for a separable polynomial, and
    connects the resulting witness to the actual `.nk` and `.nkThenPellet`
    component certifiers. `Completeness/RootFreeConverse.lean` associates
    every retained square at separation depth with a unique nearby root;
    glue connectivity propagates that association through a component.
    `Completeness/SurvivorComponent.lean` consequently bounds the enclosing
    square's precision loss by two levels. A root-bearing component at leaf
    precision `separationDepth p + 3` therefore certifies: two levels pay for
    `encSquare`, and one pays for the doubled NK base.
11. **Driver completeness**: `Completeness/DriverCompleteness.lean` closes
    the rootless-survivor-halo alternative by matching the executable driver
    to a prefix of uniform global subdivision and regluing. At
    `completenessDepth p target = max target (separationDepth p) + 5`, every
    maximal component contains its associated nearby root: any halo square is
    adjacent to the component containing that root and hence glued into it.
    The preceding NK and Pellet converses then make every component pass
    `certify?` with `k = 1` under `.nk`, `.pellet`, and `.nkThenPellet`.
    Mahler separation makes their stored discs pairwise disjoint. An
    already-ready, pairwise-disjoint all-atom worklist may emit before that
    depth; the fuel induction discharges this fast path directly from the
    executable `allAtoms` guard. Otherwise the proof carries coverage and
    precision through the actual `refineAll`, closes the structural fuel
    induction for `isolateLoop`/`isolateAll?`, and proves:

    ```lean
    theorem isolate_isSome (p : Hex.ZPoly) (h : Hex.HasOnlySimpleRoots p)
        (hp : p ≠ 0) (atomPrec : Int) (strategy : Hex.AtomStrategy) :
        (Hex.isolate p h atomPrec strategy).isSome = true
    ```

    Nonzero constants take the executable empty-output branch. Positive-degree
    inputs use the Cauchy component and the full normalized driver. Thus the
    `none` branch is impossible for every nonzero squarefree input and every
    atom strategy.

The candidate contributions have no `HexRoots` dependence and can
be split out or sent to Mathlib if they grow. The library is verified
by building it. Conformance fixtures live with `hex-roots`.

`Kantorovich.lean` is the attributed Mathlib-only Mehta--Macbeth core: it
derives a quantitative contraction theorem from `ContractingWith`, proves the
general Newton--Kantorovich result, and obtains the finite-dimensional form by
showing the approximate inverse is surjective and hence injective in equal
dimensions. Polynomial and executable-witness specialization belongs in
`KantorovichPoly.lean`, not in the generic module.
