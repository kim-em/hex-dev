The Newton-Kantorovich atom witnesses of the complex root isolator. On the
closed square `s` itself (with the sup norm, so the square is the closed ball
of radius `r = 2^{−s.prec}` about its centre), the exact Taylor coefficients
`(c₀, …, c_n)` of `p` at the centre yield three strict exact-dyadic
comparisons certifying that `p` has exactly one root there, simple, in the open
square. Identifying ℂ with ℝ² carrying the sup norm, multiplication by `ζ` is a
matrix whose sup-operator norm is `hi(ζ)` exactly, which is what makes the
Newton-Kantorovich hypotheses exact-dyadic comparisons rather than error
budgets.

With `A` the approximate inverse of `p'(m)` built from the exact reciprocal
`w = conj(c₁)·invAtPrec (normSq c₁)` of `c₁`, and `dₖ = w·cₖ`, the witness data
is `y = lo(d₀)` (the sup norm of the Newton residual), `z₁ = hi(1 − d₁)` (the
sup-operator norm of `1 − A∘p'(m)`), and the radial Lipschitz bound
`z₂ = 2·Σ_{k=2}^{n} k·hi(dₖ)·ρ^{k−2}` with `ρ = 1449·2^{−prec−10}` the dyadic
upper bound for `√2·r`. The checks are `0 < normSq c₁`,
`y + z₁·r + z₂·r²/2 < r`, and `z₁ + z₂·r < 1`.

The atom certificate is a disjunction of this Newton-Kantorovich form with the
single-root Pellet form, so consumers of isolations never care which route
fired. Everything reachable from `nkWitnessCheck` is `@[expose]`, so the kernel
reduces the witnesses across module boundaries under `decide`; the range fold
below (rather than a `for` loop or `Array.map`) is what makes that reduction go
through.

/-- The Newton-Kantorovich contraction check on the closed square `s` itself
    (sup norm), with `r = 2^{−s.prec}` the half-width. Writing
    `cs = taylor p s.center` for the exact Taylor coefficients and requiring
    `2 ≤ cs.size` with `0 < normSq c₁`, it builds the exact reciprocal
    `w = conj(c₁)·invAtPrec (normSq c₁) q` (pinned precision
    `q = 8 + max 0 (ceilLog2 (normSq c₁))`), the residuals `dₖ = w·cₖ`, and the
    exact dyadic bounds `y = lo(d₀)`, `z₁ = hi(1 − d₁)`, and the radial
    Lipschitz bound `z₂ = 2·Σ_{k=2}^{n} k·hi(dₖ)·ρ^{k−2}` with `ρ = s.radiusHi`.
    It then returns the conjunction of the three strict exact-dyadic
    comparisons `0 < normSq c₁`, `y + z₁·r + z₂·r²/2 < r`, and
    `z₁ + z₂·r < 1`. -/
