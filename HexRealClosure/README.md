# Rational selected-root expressions

`Root.validate` checks a `Hex.SignDet.RawDescriptor Rat Nat` against its exact
version tag. The tag is a `Nat` and does not yet own a defining polynomial or
dependency graph. An `Expression d` stores a rational polynomial evaluated at the
real root selected by `d`. Its arithmetic is polynomial arithmetic; distinct
expressions can have the same value. `Expression.sign?` uses checked joint sign
determination. `Expression.inverse?` computes a gcd/cofactor split and a scaled
Bézout candidate, then checks its product at the selected root. A successful
inverse has a proof of its real value in
`adapters/HexRealClosureMathlib/SelectedRoot.lean`.
The companion also proves that the selected root lies in the computed cofactor
for a nonzero value, that squarefreeness makes this cofactor coprime to the
operand, and that the scaled Bézout candidate has product one. Once both sign queries
return, `inverse?` cannot fail its candidate check. Total sign-query producer
success remains an upstream requirement.

```lean
let d ← Root.validate 7 raw
let a : Expression d := ⟨DensePoly.ofCoeffs #[0, 1]⟩
let sign ← a.sign?.toOption
let inverse ← a.inverse?.toOption
```

Both sign and inverse expose producer errors. `inverse?` returns `none` only
for a checked zero; a failed product check returns `InverseError.candidate`.
`Expression.transport` accepts checked `SignDet.Reencoding` evidence; its real
value is preserved. `Root.rebind?` revalidates the same root under a new context
version, and `Expression.rebind` transports a polynomial through that checked
conversion. `Expression.split?` combines cofactor re-encoding and rebinding;
`Expression.refine` transports stored values through both checks.
`Root.validate_context` rejects raw evidence from another context version.
The checked rebind preserves the selected value, but a version change alone
does not enforce context ownership or transport dependent objects. Full
context changes and nested transport remain separate. These interfaces do not
yet supply canonical-zero storage or total field operations.

Run `lake build HexRealClosure.Tests HexQuerySemantics` and
`python3 HexRealClosure/verify.py` from the repository root. The test uses
`(X²−2)(X−3)` with the root in `(1,2)`, plus a non-monic definition and a
checked factor split. The Python oracle computes exact arithmetic in ℚ(√2)
independently of Lean for eleven cases and is run manually; CI builds the Lean
`#guard` tests.
The companion proofs inherit the named #10389 admission in
`HexRealRootsMathlib.Tarski.check_rootSum`; no new admission is used here.

`adapters/HexRealClosureMathlib/Canonical.lean` uses the existing integer
root-list completeness theorem to show that every checked rational selected
root has a matching `RealAlgebraicNumber`, even when its defining polynomial
is reducible. `Expression.canonicalValue` evaluates the stored polynomial
using canonical real-algebraic arithmetic; its real value agrees with
`Expression.denote`; expression equality, addition, multiplication,
successful inversion and returned signs agree. The choice of the matching
canonical root is semantic and
noncomputable. An executable conversion remains to be implemented.

For existing canonical number-field arithmetic and conversions, see the
[number-field chapter](../HexManual/Chapters/HexNumberField.lean) and
[real-algebraic chapter](../HexManual/Chapters/HexRealAlgebraic.lean).
